<h4>Ambrosia Is Going International</h4>
<p>Pensacola, Florida (April 2014) - Ambrosia Inc, known for providing signature freshly baked cupcakes announced that there are official plans to open a new store in downtown Paris, France in the summer of  2015. 
“This is a big step for Ambrosia, we have gotten many request to bring our stores internationally, and we thought what a better place to do it than in Paris,” stated Co-CEO Tranice Wiley. Ambrosia has been meeting the needs of its international consumers for years by taking online orders and using high quality packaging techniques to maintain the freshness and quality of each cupcake that takes an international journey. Ambrosia has grown from a small town brand to a nationally recognized must have treat. “We never thought that Ambrosia would grow to be this big, we loved sharing our cupcakes with family, friends, and neighbors, but now we have the chance to share them with the world and it’s exciting,” says Co-CEO Ta’Quanyia Stallworth.</p>
<p>Ambrosia wants to continue to maintain its social corporate responsibility and provide its new and existing customers with superior customer service. The owners started this bakery from the ground up in the summer of 2009, they hope that one day everyone can say that had the chance to taste Ambrosia’s beautifully hand crafted gourmet cupcakes.</p>
